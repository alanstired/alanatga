# September IDP: Brick Breaker

## Instructions: 

In 2048, you combine like-numbered tiles numbered with powers of two until you get a tile with the value of 2048.

Gameplay consists of using the arrow keys, and any tiles that match in the direction and adjacent spot will combine in the direction you pressed.


For my October IDP I decided to create a python game of 2048. I spent most of my time creating the game board and the mechanics of the game. 

This game didn't require as many mechanics as the brick breaker, but getting the individual squares to what they should be needed a bit of work.

I am mainly splitting the process in between the board setup and gameplay.

Board:

- grid and each color value cooresponding to each tile
- compressing and merging the grid
- detection on whether we can combine the tiles
- painting the grid

Gameplay:
- initializing the variables
- keypress detection and actions
- detects if the game is already lost or not
